My name is Andrew Eveld, and I am a current Senior at Hendrix College in
Conway, Arkansas. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I am 21 years old, and I have one older
brother, one older sister and two younger sisters. I have a beautiful fiance√© name Mikayla, and we're getting married in June 2022. 

I am currently working part-time at Acxiom as an Intern - Solution Developer. I previously worked at PNC Bank as a Software Developer Intern, and I am currently a member of Disco Tray Studios at Hendrix College. 

I like to work on projects and use my programming skills to solve real problems. I have experience developing web and mobile apps, writing scripts, and working with databases. 
I hope you, the reader, find this blog informative and enjoyable.
