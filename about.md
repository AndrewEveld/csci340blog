My name is Andrew Eveld, and I am a current Sophomore at Hendrix College in
Conway, Arkansas. I am pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and
considering minoring in Mathematics. I am twenty years old, and I have one older
brother, one older sister and two younger sisters. Yes I am a middle child and it's
great because I'm also the favorite child.

I like to watch movies and play video games. I also like to write cool projects
in Python and Java. I am learning HTML and CSS in one of my computer science classes.
I hope you, the reader, find this blog informative and enjoyable.
