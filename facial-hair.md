During my Freshman year of college (last year at the time of writing this), I
decided to grow out my beard because I no longer went to a school that forced
me to shave. A perk of growing out my beard was that it deterred most of the
acne that would pop up on my face. This one perk was the main reason I decided
to keep my beard grown out for so long. Recently, I chose to shave my beard.
Finally shaving it off after over a year of not shaving was a wonderful experience.
My face felt free from the pokey beard that had nuzzled up against it for a very
long time. I did not think there could possibly be a downside to shaving my beard.
I was mistaken. During my most recent history class, as we were reenacting life in
ancient Athens, the gods decided to send blessings upon those who had facial hair
(real and not real). These blessings were a great many votes in the assembly. Votes
that I could not enjoy in because I decided to shave my beard less than a week ago.
