With the semester just beginning, one of our goals here at Disco Tray Studios is to wrap up the development of Good Vibes and reslease the final product to the all the App Stores on both iOS and Android. There are a few improvements we need to add before it is fully ready for deployment.

Over the past couple weeks, I have been attempting to finish the last developments of the app but have run into many problems with running the app on the my iPhone. I have been unable to pinpoint the issue, but I think it all started because I moved all of my software development applications to my external harddrive.

After having issues for hours, I cleared up some space on my internal storage and moved the development applications back to my laptop. This still didn't fix the issue, and I continued to have XCode and Flutter errors. All of this to say that the progress on Good Vibes so far this semester has been very minimal, and I'm still working through XCode build errors.

I have decided that it would be best for me to ignore the issues on iOS development, and finish implementing the improvements by testing on Android. The one issue we won't be able to fix on Android is the problem we have been having with ads not displaying on iOS devices. Andrei has been looking into this problem, but can't test it because he doesn't have an Apple computer.

This semester we're making some improvements to the Hendrix Assessment website. The first issue I fixed was a problem where a teacher could open an assessment that was completed by their partner teacher. The reason for this issue was that the query was looking for assessments that contained the current teacher's id, instead of accepting assessments with the partner teacher's is as well.
