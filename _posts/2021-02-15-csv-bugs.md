This week I worked on fixing some bugs that appeared in the admin CSV page. This page is dedicated to displaying the results of all of the assessments to the admin. One of the bugs is that Assessment Options of some classes gets duplicated at attributed to the wrong classes. I believe that this is a problem with the query that gets the Assessment Options from the database. I was able to fix this issue on my machine, but for some reason the problem remains on the remote website. We were able to give this issue a closer look during the meeting, but none of the other members of Disco Tray Studios could come up with a solution. Hopefully, I can resolve this issue this week.

The other projects are going along finely. The ideas for the "Good Vibes" app are becoming more concrete, and we have people who have begun to work on the remote firebase database. This app should be very helpful and motivational to a lot of the future users.
