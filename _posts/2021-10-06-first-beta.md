This week and last week, we released the first beta version of Good Vibes to students in Dr. Goadrich's TEC class. We were able to get notifications, analytics, and a number of smaller changes implemented for this beta release. The days leading up to the release on Friday October 1 were very busy with a lot of adjustments being made to the app. Releasing a product to testers is an exciting experience, and I am looking forward to all of the feedback that we receive. 

I have learned a lot about building and releasing apps for both iOS and Android, and there is still much for me to learn. Right now we are sticking with Firebase deployment to keep everything localized, but I think we will need to move away from Firebase deployment once we start releasing the beta to more users. We will need to utilize Apple's and Google's testing services because they are meant for larger scale testing than what Firebase Deployment is intended. 

This week and next week I am working on adding push notifications to notify users when another user send them a Good Vibe. I still do not know how to implement this functionality, but I'm ready to learn.
