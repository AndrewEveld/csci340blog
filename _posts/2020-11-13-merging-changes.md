We have many different parts of the Hendrix Assessment being worked on at the same time. The pieces being worked on by Innocent, Griffith and me happen to involve much of the same parts of the project. This week we were tasked with figuring out how to merge all of our different pieces.

This task was a great exercise in taking advantage of the things that git allows teams to accomplish. The merging aspect was simple because we each knew the code that each of our pieces needed to work. The problems arose whenever we tried to run the project after merging.

Fortunately, it didn't take too much tinkering to get each of our pieces to work as expected. Now we have javascript validation working thanks to Griffith. We have the ability to update assessments instead of generating entirely new assessments thanks to Innocent. And we have a new table UI with help icons and the ability to submit assessments for all kinds of classes. For more information about my contributions you can look at my post from last week.

Now we are looking forward to add some functionality for the admins such as viewing the information and generating excel files.
