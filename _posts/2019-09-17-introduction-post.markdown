Creating this blog website was a new experience for me. I had navigated the terminal before but I had never used Ruby or jekyll. The only think I had much trouble on was figuring out if the version of Ruby that is currently on my mac would work for this project. I spent about thirty minutes trying to (unsuccessfully) update Ruby before I decided to continue on without doing so. Every other part of this assignment worked smoothly.

I was very relieved that I was able to get jekyll to work because I expected it to be much more confusing and difficult than it turned out to be. Writing posts is very easy, and I feel like I understand all of the basic functions of jekyll. I look forward to becoming more familiar with jekyll and other web based things this semester.
