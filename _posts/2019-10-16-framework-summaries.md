Ruby on Rails is a web framework that is powered by the ruby programming language.
This framework does a lot of the work for you in the background so there is not much
that you need to understand about the SQL side of the code. However, understanding
all of the interactions between the views and controllers etc can get complex,
especially those new to web frameworks and ruby. Installation is simple and it's
a fast framework if you deal with the garbage collector properly, and it does some
simple caching automatically once you create a project. It is past the hight of
its popularity, but it is still a very popular framework.

Django is a framework that is very simple to use and easy to learn. It is powered
by the python programming language. It is a very versatile framework that can
be used to build almost any kind of application. It is the most popular framework
in use today.

Flask is another easy to use Python framework. This framework is dependent on other
softwares for things like generating a database and having SQL capabilities. It is
considered a lightweight framework so one can imagine that it is a user friendly
framework.

Express is a web framework that is powered by Node.js. This framework is a very
flexible and pluggable framework. It utilizes pug which is a terse language for
writing HTML templates. You need node.js to install it onto your computer.

ASP.NET is a web framework that can be powered by any supported .NET programming
language. It offers three different frameworks for creating web applications which
gives it many different uses. It is developed my Microsoft and so users can rely
on it always being up to date with the latest and current software.

Laravel is a web framework that is powered by the PHP programming language. This
framework helps developers with the MVC framework much like some of the other
frameworks. It has many of the capabilities of a powerful web application already
in use when you create a Laravel project such as SQL and caching.
