Last week we had a very successful meeting with the faculty members who have ideas for games that they would like to be designed for their purposes. Some of the takeaways that I had from this meeting is that the faculty would need to get together all of the information that will be useful for the student developers. They will need to keep in mind that not all of these students are skilled or even familiar with the fields that the faculty are members of. I believe that it would be most productive if the faculty can make some detailed documentation about a the interactions that they expect in the game. They would also need to detail the outcomes of any action that is carried out in-game. In some scenarios, it may be beneficial to point the developers to some pre-existing resources, but, if these resources are explained at a really high level, the student developer may have a lot of trouble understanding the content.

For the Hendrix Assessment project, I have added the methods of assessment to the CSV page and to the CSV downloaded file. This page now contains much of the information that is contained within this project. I am looking forward to making some more improvements to the website now that I have time to polish some things up.

The other members of Disco Tray Studios are doing well in all of their endeavors.
