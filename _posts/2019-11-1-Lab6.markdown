The Khan Academy tutorial was adequate for this lab. It gave clear instructions
on the uses and purposes of jQuery. The most frustrating part about combining APIs
was finding a way to combine two different APIs in a way that made sense. Neither
of my chosen APIs were really related to each other but I thought that I found an
interesting way to use the capabilities of both of them. The user draws cards from
a deck they can generate using a button. Each card they draw contributes to a score.
The score is the number used to get an interesting fact about the number of the score.
I found that getting each API to work was very satisfying. I anticipation many more
problems especially because the APIs aren't under my direct control.
