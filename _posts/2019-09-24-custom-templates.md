<a href="https://www.wowthemes.net/jekyll-themes-templates/">Custom Templates</a>
are a great tool to design good looking posts without having
to worry too much about designing layout yourself. A part that were new to me
was downloading another person's code off of GitHub and then integrating
the code with my own code. This integration was confusing to me because it took
some time for me to figure out which parts of my code I needed to keep and which
parts I needed to fully replace. It also took me a while to figure out how to
edit the css code until I realized that I just needed to change the name of the
image I was trying to include to the default image in the website.

I ended up referring to the <a href="https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul">
GitHub</a> website for information on where I should put certain things. After
completing the second step, I now realize that there were a lot of things that
I made more complicated that should not have been complicated. In the future,
if I create a new blog, I will probably start with a template before I create
anything on my actual blog. I think that would make things simpler for me.
