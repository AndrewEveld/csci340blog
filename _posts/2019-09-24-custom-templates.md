Custom templates are a great tool to design good looking posts without having
to worry too much about designing layout yourself. A part that were new to me
was downloading another person's code off of github and then integrating
the code with my own code. This integration was confusing to me because it took
some time for me to figure out which parts of my code I needed to keep and which
parts I needed to fully replace.
