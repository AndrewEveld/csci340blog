This week I mainly focused on working on the submission of Assessment in the Hendrix Assessment project. Griffith proposed a new way we could generate the table that the user uses to input their assessment information. I focused on implementing his ideas and was able to bring his vision to fruition.

An aspect of the tables I still plan to implement is the Option description that will be contained within information icons.

I also enabled the ability of the user to generate assessment forms for TEC classes and classes that have multiple topics. Each topic has its own table now and an Assessment is submitted per topic. We are really close to having all of the functionality for users completed.
